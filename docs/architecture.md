## API Design

The API will follow RESTful principles with the following main endpoints:

```
/api/auth                    # Authentication endpoints
/api/users                   # User management
/api/organizations           # Organization management
/api/suppliers               # Supplier management
/api/products                # Product management
/api/supply-chain            # Supply chain data
/api/grievances              # Grievance management
/api/satellite               # Satellite monitoring (mocked)
/api/kpis                    # KPI tracking
/api/surveys                 # Survey management
/api/responses               # Survey responses
/api/admin                   # Admin settings
```

## Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control with the following roles:
  - Admin: Full access to all features
  - Analyst: Read access to all data, write access to analysis
  - Supplier: Access to own profile and surveys
  - Partner: Limited access to specific data

## Future Extensibility

The modular architecture allows for:

1. **Microservices Migration**: Each module can be extracted into a separate microservice
2. **Real API Integration**: Mock services can be replaced with real satellite API integrations
3. **Advanced Analytics**: The risk algorithm can be enhanced with machine learning
4. **Mobile Applications**: The API design supports future mobile client development
5. **Blockchain Integration**: Supply chain data can be secured with blockchain technology

## Development Approach

For the MVP, we will:

1. Develop a monolithic application with clear module boundaries
2. Use mock data and services where appropriate
3. Focus on core functionality with clean, maintainable code
4. Implement a responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
5. Document all APIs and components for future development
